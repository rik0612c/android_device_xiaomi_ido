<!-- 
    This is a skeleton device manifest. Notes: 
    1. android.hidl.*, android.frameworks.*, android.system.* are not included.
    2. If a HAL is supported in both hwbinder and passthrough transport, 
       only hwbinder is shown.
    3. It is likely that HALs in passthrough transport does not have
       <interface> declared; users will have to write them by hand.
    4. A HAL with lower minor version can be overridden by a HAL with
       higher minor version if they have the same name and major version.
    5. sepolicy version is set to 0.0. It is recommended that the entry
       is removed from the manifest file and written by assemble_vintf
       at build time.
